Topic: Teacher course planning tool

Sprint Number: 2

Scrum Master: Hunter Fields

Git Master: Jack Featherstone


1.
**Sprint Goal:** The goal of this sprint is to improve the capabilities of our teacher course planning tool by implementing a suite of features that enable instructors to manage their courses more effectively. This sprint will focus on developing functionalities that allow instructors to set and manage due dates for themselves, their TAs, and their students with customizable visibility options. We aim to introduce the ability for instructors to switch between different courses they are teaching, and to enhance the platform by incorporating to-do lists and document sharing capabilities for all users involved in a course.

**How many User Stories did you add to the Product Backlog:**  3 User Stories were added to the Product Backlog

**How many User Stories did you add to this Sprint:** 
10 User Stories were added to the Sprint

Sprint Planning Questions:

Why did you add these US, why do you think you can get them done in the next Sprint?
These user stories align with our sprint goal of enhancing the platform's course management and organizational features.  These User Stories add value by aiming to provide a more intuitive and efficient user experience for instructors, TAs, and students. These stories directly contribute to creating a more engaging and manageable learning environment.

Why do you think these fit well with your Sprint goal? (details)
These user stories align closely with our sprint goal to improve course management and enhance the user experience for instructors, TAs, and students. Implementing these features will directly address the needs for better planning, communication, and navigation within the planner. These User Stories assist in achieving our objective of creating a more organized and user-friendly educational environment.

Do you have a rough idea what you need to do? (if the answer is no then please let me know on Slack) Yes.

Sprint Review:

Screencast link:

What do you think is the value you created this Sprint?
During this sprint, we added value to the program by implementing the framework for key features that a teacher would expect to use on a day-to-day basis with the course planning tool. The changes made should enhance the security and usability of the program.

Do you think you worked enough and that you did what was expected of you?
Overall, most of the team worked hard on this sprint, and made some improvements. There were several struggles the team ran into with schedule conflicts, IDE struggles, tasks for user stories being more complex than originally expected, and not every team member participating.

Would you say you met the customers’ expectations? Why, why not?
We made solid improvements to the program, however it feels like the program is in more of a state of transition, where it is no longer a basic calendar app, but not quite where it needs to be yet. Of course, there is still sprint 3 to make a final push towards that end goal.

Sprint Retrospective:

Did you meet your sprint goal?
We did not quite meet the sprint goal! There were a few key features that were not able to be fully implemented, but quite a few parts were completed by those still working on the project. A few tasks were not completed due to higher complexity to resolve than originally expected.

Did you complete all stories on your Sprint Backlog?
No, we did not complete all stories on the Sprint Backlog.

If not, what went wrong?
Not every team member was able to participate, combined with the other team members having their hands full with their own user stories and respective tasks. The tasks we created ended up being too complex, leading us to not finish or not fully finish parts of some user stories.

Did you work at a consistent rate of speed, or velocity? (Meaning did you work during the whole Sprint or did you start working when the deadline approached.)
We started working on this sprint later than expected due to quick turnaround times between sprints, many members being tied up with Individual Assignment 3, and wanting to ensure our first meeting was synchronous. Most people's schedules do not align closely. However, once we had drafted our sprint goals and tasks, work was semi/mostly consistent by those still working on the project, with some rush towards the end. With some tasks taking longer than expected, it took longer to see those updates in pull requests and on the taiga board.

Did you deliver business value?
We delivered some business value but not enough, by working on improvements towards the target goal for the program. The last sprint will be crucial in providing proper value due to our struggles with this sprint.

Did you follow the Scrum process (e.g. move Tasks correctly?, keep the Taiga board up to date? work consistently?)
Yes, scrum meetings were held, Taiga board was kept up to date as tasks were in different stages. Work was semi consistent throughout the sprint.

Are there things the team thinks it can do better in the next Sprint? (not needed for last Sprint)
The team needs to start earlier in the last sprint, holding that sprint start meeting asynchronously might be necessary to give ourselves more time to work on the sprint.

How do you feel at this point? Get a pulse on the optimism of the team.
Overall, this sprint was a tough one for the team, and we will need to tie up quite a few loose ends in the last sprint.

Starting in Sprint 2 Include a screenshot of your Burndown chart here and analyze in detail for me why it looks the way it does and how you could improve it if it needs improving.

The team started off the sprint late due to the sprint planning happening later than it should. The reason the burndown did not see major progress throughout the sprint was the limited project members working on the project combined with tasks and user stories taking us longer than expected. To improve, we need to get all team members working on the sprint during the sprint window, and we should make tasks easier to complete that the burndown reflects our progress more closely. We need to ensure we get the sprint planning done on day one of the first sprint so that in the next sprint we give ourselves more time to work on the project.

Team member -- Raul Silaghi:
**Do you think you individually worked consistently and put in enough work into the project (give a short answer).
I start working late on the group project and did not complete everything I wanted done.  I would have liked making the "Save" button function properly/entirely in the "Add Assignment" function that was added.

**Do you think you individually worked consistently and put in enough work into the project (give a short answer).
My work was very consistent this sprint, as I kept a good pace of slowly building each component of my assigned tasks. Utilizing the unit tests and create a good code review to document my progress helped give insight as to what direction I need to take this project in the next sprint.

Team member -- Jack Featherstone:
**Do you think you individually worked consistently and put in enough work into the project (give a short answer).
I worked consistently to the best of my ability. The sprint planning was delayed, so I wasn't able to get started as early as I would have liked. Trying to balance completing my individual assignments and the group work has been difficult, and I believe I have completed my share of the work during this sprint.

I was not able to work consistently as I was ill (and have a Dr.s note if needed.)  However, i did communicate throughout the sprint and completed a User Story and had several 1 on 1 calls with teammates to assist with IDE and git issues.

**Do you think you individually worked consistently and put in enough work into the project (give a short answer).
I didn't work as consistently as I would have liked due to other homework and school taking up an unexpected amount of time along with the sprint starting later than expected, but I was still able to chip away at the project slowly. I finished 1/2 of my US of implementing visibility with the other relying on functionality that needs to be discussed further with group memebers.
