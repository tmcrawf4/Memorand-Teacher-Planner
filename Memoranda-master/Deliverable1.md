Sprint Number: 1

Scrum Master: Matt

Git Master: Raul


1.
**Sprint Goal:** The goal for this sprint is to fix any and all disruptive user interface errors, make the planner display strictly in English, and make backend changes by debugging the Memoranda application to streamline the user experience.

**How many User Stories did you add to the Product Backlog:**  3 User Stories were added to the Product Backlog

**How many User Stories did you add to this Sprint:** 
11 User Stories were added to the Sprint

Sprint Planning Questions:

> These user stories are intended to create a more stable application by minimizing any potential bugs or errors, along with serving as a basic framework for the features requested in the future for the final product. These features seem relatively simple to implement, and should be a good starting point to become familiar with the project.

> These user stories fit well with the sprint goal as many of the stories are fixing existing problems with the UI. The exit and minimize errors are clearly disruptive to the user experience, and should be prioritized according to our goal. The mixed language issue, the icon and look and feel confusion, and the generalized splash screen are all basic disruptive problems that should be fixed.

> Yes.

Sprint Review:

**Screen Cast link:** https://youtu.be/JgwFRO_UkHA

What do you think is the value you created this Sprint?
The value created this Sprint was to communicate with other team members, work in collaboration, and to build the foundation for our group project.
Do you think you worked enough and that you did what was expected of you?
Yes, everyone has done their share of the work for the project.
Would you say you met the customers’ expectations? Why, why not?
Yes, we met the customers’ expectations, because we are on track to fulfill the customer’s initial requirements created this Sprint.  

Sprint Retrospective:

Did you meet your sprint goal?
>Yes, as we were able to fix many errors within the program regarding the depreciated API along with inconsistencies in the language used for labels in the program, making the program more stable and user friendly.

Did you complete all stories on your Sprint Backlog?
>Yes, all besides one that we would like to expand upon on a later Sprint.

If not, what went wrong?
>New task for a story was created towards the end of the Sprint. The User Story contained a threading problem which was much more complex than predicted.

Did you work at a consistent rate of speed, or velocity? (Meaning did you work during the whole Sprint or did you start working when the deadline approached.)
>Yes, work was done consistently throughout the project.

Did you deliver business value?
>We have done improvements to memoranda that will later lead to business value being delivered.

Did you follow the Scrum process (e.g. move Tasks correctly?, keep the Taiga board up to date? work consistently?)
>Yes, tasks were moved and completed accordingly.

Are there things the team thinks it can do better in the next Sprint? (not needed for last Sprint)
>We have discussed more meetings and updates with progress for the next Sprints.  We will also discuss standardized naming of branches, and requirements for what we want to see in commit messages, to make looking for prior changes easier.

How do you feel at this point? Get a pulse on the optimism of the team.
>We are feeling good.  The team is working well together.

Starting in Sprint 2 Include a screenshot of your Burndown chart here and analyze in detail for me why it looks the way it does and how you could improve it if it needs improving.

Team member -- Hunter Fields:
**Do you think you individually worked consistently and put in enough work into the project (give a short answer).
