Topic: Teacher course planning tool

Sprint Number: 3

Scrum Master: Olivia Horwedel

Git Master: Tristan Crawford


1.
**Sprint Goal:** The goal of this sprint is to work to complete the implementation of visibility and assignment creation functionality, along with fixing bugs and inconsistency such as repeatable events not being recorded properly.

**How many User Stories did you add to the Product Backlog:** 
> 0 User Stories were added to the Product Backlog

**How many User Stories did you add to this Sprint:** 
> 13 User Stories were added to the Sprint

Sprint Planning Questions:

Why did you add these US, why do you think you can get them done in the next Sprint?
> These user stories were added to wrap up the unfinished features currently implemented in the program. Many of them are minor tweaks to existing features and should be easily completable. Some of the larger tasks may pose a challenge, but the team seems prepared to make a good attempt.

Why do you think these fit well with your Sprint goal? (details)
> These user stories fit well with the sprint goal as most of them focus on finishing up visibility and assignment functionality. Some unfinished user stories were also added, and these pertained to making visibility save and display properly for objects. Minor bugs and inconsistencies are also being addressed by fixing repeatable events and making visibility have a consistent menu. 

Do you have a rough idea what you need to do? (if the answer is no then please let me know on Slack) 
> Yes.

Sprint Review:

Screencast link:
- [Screencast video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gFYrnUy4VM)

What do you think is the value you created this Sprint?

> The value created in this sprint was resonable. The new functionality for accounts and visibility maees the program more functional for a classroom setting. Each tier of user now only sees events and tasks that are applicable to them.


Do you think you worked enough and that you did what was expected of you?

> A fair amount of work was done and the sprint goal is mostly accomplished.


Would you say you met the customersâ€™ expectations? Why, why not?

> As a final product, the customer's expectations are likely not met. However, when considering the requirements in the Topics document, it seems that the program is close to fully complete with valuable implementations for about 8 of the 10 requirements.


Sprint Retrospective:

Did you meet your sprint goal?

> The sprint goal was nearly met, with the exception of clearing all CheckStyle warnings. 

Did you complete all stories on your Sprint Backlog? 

> All user stories in Sprint 3 were completed with the exception of US90 Task91. 


If not, what went wrong?

> The massive amount of CheckStyle errors was too much for the assigned member to complete alone.


Did you work at a consistent rate of speed, or velocity? (Meaning did you work during the whole Sprint or did you start working when the deadline approached.)

> The rate of work was inconsistent, with almost all of the work being done within the final 5 days.


Did you deliver business value?

> Value was delivered, as the program should now function as an intuitive course planner.


Did you follow the Scrum process (e.g. move Tasks correctly?, keep the Taiga board up to date? work consistently?)

> The Scrum process was followed, and thhe Taiga board accurately represented the work being done on the project.


Are there things the team thinks it can do better in the next Sprint? (not needed for last Sprint)


How do you feel at this point? Get a pulse on the optimism of the team.


Starting in Sprint 2 Include a screenshot of your Burndown chart here and analyze in detail for me why it looks the way it does and how you could improve it if it needs improving.

**Do you think you individually worked consistently and put in enough work into the project (give a short answer).
Yes, I feel like a good amount of contribution was done on my end for this sprint.  I would have liked to do more, but due to personal issues I could not allocate more time to this Sprint.

Team member -- Tristan Crawford:
**Do you think you individually worked consistently and put in enough work into the project (give a short answer).
Yes, I worked consistently throughout this sprint. However, I did run into some issues that slowed my progress such as build errors or mere conflicts that needed to be resolved, but I made sure to allocate time for my project and create a checklist of tasks that I wanted to complete by a certain time to ensure that my tasks were done in a timely manner.

Team member -- Jack Featherstone:
**Do you think you individually worked consistently and put in enough work into the project (give a short answer).

> I was not able to work as consistently as I wanted to. The first week of the sprint I felt compelled to prioritize Assignment 5b and only began my tasks after I had finished it. Once I began working however, I felt that I worked quite consistently and pushed new features at least once every day / two days. I believe I did plenty of work on coding for this sprint.

Team member -- Hunter Fields:
**Do you think you individually worked consistently and put in enough work into the project (give a short answer).
I felt as though I started probably a little late but worked consistenetly, got a solid amount done, and put in enough work during this sprint. I felt like I could have given more if there were not a lot of other assignments going on at the same time.

**Do you think you individually worked consistently and put in enough work into the project (give a short answer).
I did not work consistently, however I participated in team meetings/chats and was available to discuss things during the Sprint.  I do believe I put in enough work this sprint and was a valuable team member.
